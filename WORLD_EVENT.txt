Clicking anywhere on the world with a clear 3x3 area spawns a god with a sanctuary. If the area is not clear,
a message will be printed in the console. The god will roam around the world, adding mountains of ore for the miners.
If a miner comes within 3 blocks of the sanctuary, they will become an angel that searches and kills ore blobs.
